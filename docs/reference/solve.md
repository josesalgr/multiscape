# Solve a planning problem

Solve a planning problem stored in a `Problem` object.

This is the main execution step of the multiscape workflow. It reads the
problem specification stored in a `Problem` object, builds the
corresponding optimization model when needed, applies the configured
solver settings, and returns either a
[`solution-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution-class.md)
or a
[`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
depending on whether the workflow is single-objective or
multi-objective.

## Usage

``` r
solve(x, ...)

# S3 method for class 'Problem'
solve(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `Problem` object created with
  [`create_problem`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/create_problem.md)
  and optionally enriched with actions, effects, targets, constraints,
  objectives, spatial relations, method settings, and solver settings.

- ...:

  Additional arguments reserved for internal or legacy solver handling.
  These are not part of the main recommended user interface.

## Value

Either:

- a
  [`solution-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution-class.md)
  object when solving a single-objective problem, or

- a
  [`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
  object when solving a configured multi-objective problem.

A `Solution` represents one optimization run. A `SolutionSet` represents
multiple runs together with their run table, design information, and
individual `Solution` objects.

After solving, users will typically inspect or visualize the returned
results through methods associated with `Solution` and `SolutionSet`
objects.

## Details

**Role of `solve()`**

The typical multiscape workflow is:


    x <- create_problem(...)
    x <- add_...(x, ...)
    x <- set_...(x, ...)
    res <- solve(x)

Thus, `solve()` is the stage at which the stored problem specification
is turned into one or more optimization runs.

For most users, `solve()` is the standard execution entry point.
Explicit compilation with
[`compile_model()`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/compile_model.md)
is optional and is mainly useful for advanced inspection or debugging
workflows.

**What `solve()` uses from the problem object**

The function uses the information already stored in the `Problem`
object, including:

- baseline planning data,

- actions, effects, profit, and spatial relations,

- targets and constraints,

- registered objectives,

- an optional multi-objective method configuration,

- solver settings.

If a model has not yet been built, it is built internally during the
solve process. If a model snapshot or pointer already exists, the
solving layer may reuse or refresh it depending on the internal model
state.

**Single-objective vs multi-objective behaviour**

The behaviour of `solve()` depends on the problem configuration.

- **Single-objective case.** If exactly one objective is active and no
  multi-objective method is configured, `solve()` runs a single
  optimization problem and returns a
  [`solution-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solution-class.md)
  object.

- **Multi-objective case.** If a multi-objective method is configured,
  `solve()` dispatches internally according to the stored method name
  and returns a
  [`solutionset-class`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/solutionset-class.md)
  object.

Currently supported multi-objective method names are:

- `"weighted"`,

- `"epsilon_constraint"`,

- `"augmecon"`.

**Consistency rule**

If multiple objectives are registered but no multi-objective method has
been selected, `solve()` stops with an error. In practical terms:

- one objective and no multi-objective method \\\Rightarrow\\
  single-objective solve,

- multiple objectives and a valid multi-objective method \\\Rightarrow\\
  multi-objective solve,

- multiple objectives and no multi-objective method \\\Rightarrow\\
  error.

**Solver settings**

Solver configuration is read from the `Problem` object, typically after
calling
[`set_solver`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_solver.md)
or one of its convenience wrappers such as
[`set_solver_gurobi`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_solver_gurobi.md)
or
[`set_solver_cbc`](https://josesalgr.github.io/multiscape/reference/set_solver_cbc.md).

These settings may include:

- the selected backend,

- time limits,

- optimality-gap settings,

- CPU cores,

- verbosity options,

- backend-specific solver parameters.

**Method dispatch**

`solve()` is an S3 generic. The public method documented here is
`solve.Problem()`, which operates on `Problem` objects.
